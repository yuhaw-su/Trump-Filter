I would like to thank [Rob Spectre](http://brooklynhacker.com) for giving me a starting point
for this project with his "Trump Filter". To see the amazing, original extension he developed, [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lhondapiaknegjpellpodegmeonigjic)!

Overview
--------------------------
In such a politically turbulent time, our college campuses have safe spaces to give us a
place of protection. However, why doesn't our browsing experience on the web have one? That's why
I developed Safespace - a customizable, content filter. Simply input whatever you don't want to see,
select your level of sensitivity, and your set!


Features
--------------------------

* Detects instances of whatever you specified on web pages, warning users of the horror they may contain.
* Attempts to identify semantically sections of the page likely to contain whatever you specified and removes them from the page.
* Sensitivity settings to customize the aggressiveness of the filter - remove single references, chunks or the entire page.

* Lovingly started in Brooklyn, NY.
* Lovingly innovated on at HackISU, Ames, IA.
